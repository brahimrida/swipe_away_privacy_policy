### Privacy Policy for Swipe Away

**Last updated:** 28-11-2025

**Swipe Away** ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use the Swipe Away mobile application.

### 1. Introduction
Swipe Away is a utility application designed to help users manage their device's photo gallery efficiently. The app allows users to swipe left to delete photos or swipe right to keep them. The app operates locally on your device to perform these file management tasks.

### 2. Information Collection and Access
**We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal photos, videos, or personal information to any external servers.**

However, to function correctly, the app requires specific permissions to access data stored on your device:

* **Photo & Video / Storage Access:** Swipe Away requires access to your device’s gallery (Read and Write permissions). This access is strictly necessary to:
    1.  Display your photos so you can review them.
    2.  Permanently delete the files you choose to remove (swipe left).
* **No Cloud Storage:** The photos you choose to "keep" (swipe right) remain untouched in your device's storage. We do not create a database of your photos, nor do we upload your content to the cloud.

### 3. Analytics
We **do not** use any third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics or Firebase) to track user behavior or crash reports.

### 4. Third-Party Services and Advertising
While the app itself does not collect personal data, we use **Google AdMob** to display advertisements. Google AdMob may collect and share certain device data automatically to provide relevant ads. This includes:

* **IP Address:** Used to estimate the general location of the device.
* **User Product Interactions:** Understanding how ads are viewed or tapped.
* **Device and Account Identifiers:** Such as the Android Advertising ID.
* **Diagnostic Information:** Crash logs related specifically to the Ad SDK.

All user data collected by the Google Mobile Ads SDK is encrypted in transit using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.

### 5. Data Handling by Google AdMob
* **Android Ad ID:** You can reset or delete your Android Advertising ID at any time through your device settings.
* **Limited Ads:** Google may limit data use via their "Limited Ads" feature depending on user consent configurations.

For more information on how Google AdMob collects, uses, and shares data, please review the [Google AdMob Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

### 6. Children’s Privacy
Swipe Away is a general audience application intended for use by adults and children to manage device storage.
* **We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under the age of 13.**
* Since the app does not require account creation and processes photos locally, no personal data regarding children is transmitted to us.

### 7. Security
Your photos and files remain entirely on your device. We do not maintain a backend server. Therefore, the security of your data relies on the security of your mobile device. We recommend keeping your device operating system updated to ensure your local data remains secure.

### 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our app's functionality or legal requirements. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically.

### 9. Contact Information
